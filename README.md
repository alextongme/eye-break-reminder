[**Download the latest DMG**](https://github.com/alextongme/count-tongulas-eye-break/releases/latest/download/CountTongulasEyeBreak.dmg)

open "/Applications/Count Tongula's Eye Break.app"
```

brew tap alextongme/cask

## Development

### Architecture

Single binary compiled from `scripts/Sources/*.swift` using SwiftPM. Depends on [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios) for animations.

```
scripts/Sources/*.swift  -->  eye_break_ui (single binary, SwiftPM)
                              |
                              +-- NSStatusItem (menu bar + countdown)
                              +-- BreakWindowController (eye + long breaks)
                              +-- SettingsWindowController (two-column prefs)
                              +-- OnboardingController (first-run setup)
                              +-- IdleDetector (CGEventSource, IOKit, DND)
                              +-- Statistics (JSON persistence, streaks)
                              +-- SoundManager (14 macOS system sounds via afplay)
                              +-- Preferences (UserDefaults)
                              +-- UpdateChecker (GitHub Releases polling)
                              +-- UpdateAlertController (update prompt window)
```

### Releasing

Tag a version and push — GitHub Actions builds the `.app` bundle, creates a GitHub Release with both `.zip` and `.dmg` artifacts, and updates the Homebrew Cask formula automatically.

```bash
git tag v0.8.0
git push --tags
```

**One-time setup:** add a `CASK_PAT` [repository secret](https://github.com/alextongme/count-tongulas-eye-break/settings/secrets/actions) with write access to `alextongme/homebrew-cask`. Create one at [GitHub fine-grained tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).

### Requirements

- macOS 12+ (Monterey or later)
- Xcode Command Line Tools (for building from source only)
